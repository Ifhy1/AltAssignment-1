  <h1>Media Page - About Me</h1>

  <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Ifeyinwa Ihedioha</strong> and this is a creative showcase of who I am using HTML media elements.</p>

  <h2>Ihedioha Ifeyinwa</h2>
  <p><em>
    This picture was taken during one of those quiet “aha” moments — when I realized I didn’t need to have it all figured out to start. I was just beginning my journey into tech, full of questions, tabs open everywhere, but excited. It reminds me that progress often starts with curiosity, not confidence.

  <p><i>This short voice note is a personal introduction — a glimpse into my journey as an aspiring cloud engineer. I talk about my passion for learning, my love for solving problems, and how I’ve come to embrace the beauty of starting over until things make sense. It reflects the messy, honest, and meaningful parts of growing in tech to finding calm in journaling, lifting weights, or losing myself in a good story. Through it all,
     I’m learning to turn confusion into clarity, fear into confidence, and ideas into real things — even if it takes ten tries.
     It’s not just about tech for me; it’s about becoming someone resilient, curious, and creative along the way.</i></p>

<p><i>From Curiosity to Cloud — My DevFest Moment

  This video captures more than just me showing up at DevFest — it marks one of my first real steps into the tech community as a beginner. I didn’t have all the answers (still don’t), but I had questions, passion, and the courage to start. Cloud engineering can feel overwhelming, but moments like this remind me: growth happens when you step out, speak up, and keep showing up — even if your hands are a little shaky.
  
  This journey isn’t perfect, but it’s mine — and I’m building it, one cloud, one commit, and one community at a time.
